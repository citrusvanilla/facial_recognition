# Facial Recognition With PCA and SVM

Full disclosure- the following code comes from the scikit-learn example of an implementation of facial recognition [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/face_recognition.html).

The dataset used in the example is a preprocessed excerpt of the ["Labeled Faces in the Wild"](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/), which can be downloaded in full here: [Full Download (233MB)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz).  Though the `fetch_lfw_people` function in the notebook makes use of the scikit-learn codebase to handle this dataset for you.
